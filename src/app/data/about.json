  "bio": "Hi, I'm Jason! I'm a pragmatic developer with a strong background in C#, observability engineering, and modern web development. I’m passionate about building scalable systems and improving software reliability.",
  "longBio": "With years of hands-on experience across the software development lifecycle, I've contributed to everything from legacy system maintenance to observability pipelines and cloud-based personal projects. My focus has been in enterprise environments where reliability, clarity, and visibility are essential.\n\nMy toolkit includes C#, React.js, PowerShell, and Datadog, but I’m equally comfortable writing automation with Ansible or scripting complex analysis in SQL. I care deeply about system health, developer efficiency, and making complexity manageable.\n\nOutside of code, I explore creative outlets like guitar, poetry, and digital art. I’m currently focused on personal growth and building a life aligned with purpose and integrity.",
